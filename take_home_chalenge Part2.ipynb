Whether or not Ultimate should pay their fees is another question, for which many other things need to be conisdered. Is there excess demand between the two cities? While we may be able to determine if drivesrs will earn more, will Ultimate earn more by paying for driver's tolls? By opening this program to all drivers will the average increase in earnings recorded by the experiment stay consistent? All of these must be considered before Ultimate can safely say it is worth while paying for driver tolls. "
